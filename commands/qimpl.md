description: Context-aware autonomous implementation session driven by a work file
---

# /qimpl Command

Run an autonomous implementation session guided by a work file. The work file defines
the goals and serves as the workspace for tracking progress. Designed for focused,
high-quality implementation bursts that stay within the top half of the context window
for optimal output quality.

Use maximum thinking budget for this prompt.

## Usage

```
/qimpl <work-file>
```

- `<work-file>` -- Path to the markdown work file that defines the session goals
  and serves as the running workspace (e.g., `work.md`, `docs/impl-plan.md`)

## Rules

1. **Senior engineer mindset** -- Approach implementation like a craftsperson who
   obsesses over pristine code with zero errors, warnings, or issues. Be methodical,
   patient, and uncompromising on quality.
2. **Work file is your hub** -- Read goals from the work file, write results back to
   it. The work file persists across sessions as the source of truth.
3. **Work file is a guide, not gospel** -- You own the implementation. Verify its
   details and adapt as needed to accomplish the goals.
4. **Context window discipline** -- Work autonomously but stop the session when
   approaching 50% context window consumption. You work best at the top of your
   context window. 50% consumption is roughly equal to 12 file reads OR 30 total
   tool calls, whichever comes first.
5. **No assumptions** -- Never guess. Pattern match precisely. Do not skim when
   details are needed. Validate systematically. Use web tools to look up and verify
   any details you are not confident in.
6. **No lying or "good enough"** -- Never misrepresent status. If something feels
   off, it probably is. Investigate rather than hand-wave.
7. **Read-only on spec system** -- Never modify state.json, session specs, or task
   checklists.
8. **ASCII only** -- All generated/modified files use characters 0-127 only.

## Steps

### 1. Load the work file

Read the work file provided by the user. Identify:
- The goal(s) of the session
- Any prior progress or context from previous sessions
- Any notes, constraints, or implementation guidance

### 2. Assess and plan

Review the current state of the codebase as it relates to the work file goals.
Verify that the work file's details are accurate -- file paths exist, assumptions
hold, referenced code matches expectations.

If anything in the work file is incorrect or outdated, note it and adapt your
approach accordingly.

### 3. Implement

Execute the work described in the work file. Follow these principles:
- Work through items methodically, one at a time
- Validate each change before moving to the next
- If you encounter uncertainty about an API, library, or pattern, use web tools
  to look it up rather than guessing
- Track your context window consumption -- monitor file reads and tool calls

### 4. Monitor context consumption

Keep a running awareness of resource usage:
- **File reads**: Stop approaching 12
- **Total tool calls**: Stop approaching 30
- Whichever limit approaches first triggers the session wrap-up

When nearing the limit, proceed to Step 5 rather than pushing further.

### 5. Update the work file

Before ending the session, update the work file with:
- What was completed this session
- What remains to be done
- Current state of the implementation (what works, what is partial)
- Any concise notes that would help the next session pick up efficiently
  (gotchas discovered, decisions made, patterns established)
- Clear next steps so a fresh session can continue without re-investigation

## Output

Report to the user:
- What was accomplished in this session
- How much of the work file's goals were completed
- Whether the session ended due to completion or context window discipline
- The work file has been updated for session continuity
