# Apex Spec System Walkthrough

A real-world walkthrough based on an actual project: **NJ Title Intelligence Platform**.

> This walkthrough uses artifacts from a production project that processed 4M+ parcels across 16 phases and 79+ sessions over 3 weeks.

---

## The Project

**NJ Title Intelligence Platform** - A property intelligence system for NJ title insurance that unifies parcel, lien, environmental, and corporate data using free public data sources.

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Phases | 16 |
| Completed Sessions | 79+ |
| Records Processed | 4M+ parcels, 105M+ historical records |
| Development Time | ~3 weeks |
| Tech Stack | Python/Litestar, PostgreSQL/PostGIS, React/Next.js |

---

## Stage 1: Initialization

### Step 1: /initspec

```
User: /initspec
```

Claude creates the spec system structure:

```
title_clerk/
|-- .spec_system/
|   |-- state.json              # Tracks progress
|   |-- CONSIDERATIONS.md       # Lessons learned
|   |-- SECURITY-COMPLIANCE.md  # Security posture & GDPR compliance
|   |-- CONVENTIONS.md          # Coding standards
|   \-- PRD/
|       \-- PRD.md              # Empty template
```

### Step 2: /createprd

```
User: /createprd "A property intelligence platform for NJ title insurance
      that maximizes FREE public data, covering 21 NJ counties, 564
      municipalities, and ~4M parcels with $0 data acquisition cost."
```

Claude generates a comprehensive PRD with phase breakdown:

```markdown
# NJ Title Intelligence Platform - PRD

## Phase Map
| Phase | Name | Sessions |
|-------|------|----------|
| 01 | Infrastructure & Project Setup | 7 |
| 02 | MOD-IV Data Pipeline | 6 |
| 03 | Core Parcel API | 4 |
| 04 | Federal Lien Integration | 5 |
| 05 | Frontend Application (Foundation) | 6 |
| 06 | Environmental Risk | 5 |
| ... | ... | ... |
| 16 | Frontend: Corporate & Admin Features | 5 |
```

### Step 3: /phasebuild

```
User: /phasebuild
```

Creates Phase 01 structure with session stubs:

```
.spec_system/PRD/phase_01/
├── README.md
├── session_01_project_structure_python_setup.md
├── session_02_docker_compose_postgresql.md
├── session_03_database_extensions_init.md
├── session_04_litestar_application_skeleton.md
├── session_05_alembic_migrations_framework.md
├── session_06_redis_celery_configuration.md
└── session_07_development_tooling_documentation.md
```

---

## Stage 2: Session Workflow

This is where the real work happens. Repeat for each session until the phase is complete.

### Step 4: /plansession

```
User: /plansession
```

Claude analyzes project state, recommends the next session, creates the specification, and generates the task checklist -- all in one step:

```markdown
# Recommendation

**Recommended**: phase09-session01-rutgers-modiv-analysis

## Why This Session
- Phase 09 is next in sequence
- Session 01 establishes historical data foundation
- Prerequisites met: Phase 02 bulk loader patterns available
```

Creates the spec and tasks in the session directory:

```
.spec_system/specs/phase09-session01-rutgers-modiv-analysis/
|-- spec.md
|-- tasks.md
\-- (security-compliance.md, validation.md created by /validate)
```

**Actual spec.md excerpt:**

```markdown
# Session Specification

**Session ID**: phase09-session01-rutgers-modiv-analysis
**Phase**: 09 - Historical Data + Workflow
**Created**: 2025-12-21

## 1. Session Overview

This session establishes the foundation for loading 105M+ historical
parcel records from Rutgers University's MOD-IV data archive (1989-present).

## 4. Scope

### In Scope (MVP)
- Analyze Rutgers MOD-IV data portal structure
- Document available data files by year and county
- Design parcel_history table with 44+ core fields
- Define partition boundaries: 1989-1999, 2000-2009, 2010-2019, 2020+
```

**Actual tasks.md excerpt:**

```markdown
# Task Checklist

**Session ID**: phase09-session01-rutgers-modiv-analysis
**Total Tasks**: 24
**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 hours

## Setup (3 tasks)

- [ ] T001 [S0901] Create `docs/historical-data/` directory structure
- [ ] T002 [S0901] Verify access to Rutgers MOD-IV portal
- [ ] T003 [S0901] Review existing Parcel model schema for reference

## Portal Analysis (5 tasks)

- [ ] T004 [S0901] Document portal navigation structure
- [ ] T005 [S0901] Identify all available tax years (1989-2024)
- [ ] T006 [S0901] Document available file formats per year
- [ ] T007 [S0901] [P] Analyze county-level data organization
- [ ] T008 [S0901] [P] Document download mechanisms and rate limits
```

### Step 5: /implement

```
User: /implement
```

Claude works through tasks one by one:

- Reads spec.md and tasks.md for context
- Implements each task sequentially
- Marks tasks `[x]` as completed
- Logs progress in implementation-notes.md
- Handles blockers with documentation

**Progress tracking in real-time:**

```markdown
## Implementation Progress

### T001 - Create directory structure
Status: Complete
Created: docs/historical-data/

### T002 - Verify portal access
Status: Complete
Portal accessible at https://modiv.rutgers.edu/
Identified: 21 counties, years 1989-2024

### T003 - Review Parcel model
Status: Complete
Reference: 44 fields in current schema
```

### Step 6: /validate

```
User: /validate
```

Claude verifies session completeness:

**Actual validation.md:**

```markdown
# Validation Report

**Session ID**: phase09-session01-rutgers-modiv-analysis
**Validated**: 2025-12-21
**Result**: PASS

| docs/historical-data/partition-design.md | Yes | 189 | PASS |
```

### Step 7: /updateprd

```
User: /updateprd
```

Claude marks session complete and commits:

- Adds session to `completed_sessions` in state.json
- Updates phase README with completion status
- **Commits and pushes** (your recovery safety net!)
- Clears `current_session`
- Reports next steps

```
Session phase09-session01-rutgers-modiv-analysis marked COMPLETE.

Phase 09 Progress: 1/8 sessions complete (12.5%)

Next: Run /plansession for session 02 recommendation.
```

### Repeat Until Phase Complete

Continue the cycle:
```
/plansession -> /implement -> /validate -> /updateprd
```

Until all sessions in the phase are done.

---

## Stage 3: Phase Transition

After completing all sessions in a phase, run the phase transition commands.

### /audit

```
User: /audit
```

Adds local dev tooling one bundle at a time:
1. Formatting (Prettier, Ruff)
2. Linting (ESLint, Ruff)
3. Type Safety (TypeScript, mypy)
4. Testing (Jest, pytest + coverage)
5. Observability (structlog, pino, tracing, slog)
6. Git Hooks (husky, pre-commit)

Run multiple times until all bundles are configured.

### /pipeline

```
User: /pipeline
```

Adds CI/CD workflows one bundle at a time:
1. Code Quality (lint + format + type check)
2. Build & Test (build + unit tests + coverage)
3. Security (secrets scanning + CodeQL)
4. Integration (E2E tests)
5. Operations (Dependabot, release tagging)

### /infra

```
User: /infra
```

Adds production infrastructure one bundle at a time:
1. Health (/health endpoint + probes)
2. Security (WAF rules + rate limiting)
3. Backup (DB backup + retention)
4. Deploy (CD webhook from main)

### /carryforward

```
User: /carryforward
```

Captures lessons learned in CONSIDERATIONS.md and updates SECURITY-COMPLIANCE.md:

**Actual excerpt from title_clerk:**

```markdown
## Lessons Learned

### What Worked

- [P01] **PostGIS + Apache AGE + pgvector stack**: Single PostgreSQL
  instance with extensions handles spatial, graph, and vector needs.

- [P02] **Idempotent bulk loader pattern**: Loading 4M+ parcels with
  UPSERT ensures reruns are safe. Always build data pipelines rerunnable.

- [P04] **CourtListener hybrid approach**: Bulk S3 dumps for initial
  seeding (unlimited), REST API for real-time (rate-limited).

- [P07] **PyMuPDF before Tesseract**: Always try native PDF text
  extraction first. OCR is 6x slower and should be fallback only.

- [P08] **5s+ delays for NJ Courts**: Respecting rate limits prevents
  WAF blocks. Aggressive scraping causes IP bans - patience wins.

### What To Avoid

- [P08] **Playwright scraper fragility**: NJ Courts scraper depends on
  DOM selectors that may break with site updates.
```

### /documents

```
User: /documents
```

Audits and updates documentation:
- README.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
- API documentation
- Per-package READMEs

### Manual Testing

**Highly recommended** - Test the phase's features manually before proceeding.

### /phasebuild (Next Phase)

```
User: /phasebuild
```

Creates structure for the next phase, then return to Stage 2.

## Real Project Timeline

The title_clerk project progressed through 16 phases:

| Date | Sessions Completed | Phases |
|------|-------------------|--------|
| Dec 8 | 6 | Phase 01 started |
| Dec 9 | 13 | Phases 01-02 complete |
| Dec 10 | 4 | Phase 03 complete |
| Dec 11 | 11 | Phases 04-05 complete |
| Dec 12-13 | 11 | Phases 06-07 complete |
| Dec 21-22 | 14 | Phases 08-09 complete |
| Dec 22-23 | 8 | Phase 10 complete |
| Dec 24 | 6 | Phase 11 complete |
| Dec 25 | 7 | Phase 12 complete |
| Dec 28 | 7 | Phase 13 complete, 14 in progress |

**79+ sessions completed in ~3 weeks** with consistent structure and documentation.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Sessions are atomic** - Each session has clear scope (12-25 tasks, 2-4 hours)

2. **State is tracked** - state.json knows exactly where you are

3. **Git is your safety net** - Every /updateprd commits and pushes

4. **Lessons accumulate** - CONSIDERATIONS.md grows with institutional memory; SECURITY-COMPLIANCE.md tracks cumulative security posture

5. **Phase transitions matter** - /audit, /pipeline, /infra ensure production readiness

6. **Trust the system** - Follow the workflow, resist scope creep

---

## Monorepo Walkthrough

A walkthrough showing how Apex Spec handles a monorepo project: **Acme SaaS Platform** with a React frontend, Python API, and shared TypeScript library.

### The Project

| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Structure | pnpm monorepo with Turborepo |
| Packages | `apps/web` (React + Next.js), `apps/api` (Python + FastAPI), `packages/shared` (TypeScript) |
| Workspace Config | `pnpm-workspace.yaml` + `turbo.json` |

### Initialization (Brownfield)

```
User: /initspec
```

The system detects the existing monorepo structure:

```
Detected monorepo structure:
  Workspace manager: pnpm (pnpm-workspace.yaml)
  Task runner: Turborepo (turbo.json)

Detected packages:
  1. apps/web       (TypeScript)
  2. apps/api       (Python)
  3. packages/shared (TypeScript)

Confirm this package list? [confirm / edit / skip]
```

After confirmation, state.json includes:

```json
{
  "monorepo": true,
  "packages": [
    { "name": "web", "path": "apps/web", "type": "frontend", "stack": "TypeScript + React" },
    { "name": "api", "path": "apps/api", "type": "backend", "stack": "Python 3.12 + FastAPI" },
    { "name": "shared", "path": "packages/shared", "type": "library", "stack": "TypeScript" }
  ]
}
```

CONVENTIONS.md gains a Workspace Structure table:

```markdown
## Workspace Structure (Monorepo)

| Package | Path | Type | Stack |
|---------|------|------|-------|
| web | apps/web | Frontend | TypeScript + React |
| api | apps/api | Backend | Python 3.12 + FastAPI |
| shared | packages/shared | Library | TypeScript |
```

### PRD and Phase Build

```
User: /createprd @docs/requirements.md
```

The PRD includes a Package Map section showing which packages are involved in each phase. Then:

```
User: /phasebuild
```

Creates phase stubs with package annotations:

```
.spec_system/PRD/phase_00/
  session_01_project_setup.md              # No Package: annotation (cross-cutting)
  session_02_shared_types.md               # Package: packages/shared
  session_03_api_models.md                 # Package: apps/api
  session_04_web_scaffold.md               # Package: apps/web
  session_05_api_endpoints.md              # Package: apps/api
  session_06_web_auth.md                   # Package: apps/web
```

### Session Workflow (Per-Package)

#### Planning a cross-cutting session

```
User: /plansession
```

The system recommends session 01 (project-setup). No package annotation -- this is cross-cutting:

```markdown
# Session Specification

**Session ID**: phase00-session01-project-setup
**Phase**: 00 - Foundation
**Created**: 2026-01-10

## Scope
- pnpm workspace configuration
- Turborepo pipeline setup
- Shared ESLint/Prettier config at root
- Docker Compose for local development
```

Tasks reference files across the entire repo:

```markdown
- [ ] T001 [S0001] Configure pnpm-workspace.yaml (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`)
- [ ] T002 [S0001] Set up Turborepo pipeline (`turbo.json`)
- [ ] T003 [S0001] Create root ESLint config (`.eslintrc.js`)
- [ ] T004 [S0001] Create Docker Compose for local dev (`docker-compose.yml`)
```

#### Planning a package-scoped session

```
User: /plansession
      "Plan session for apps/api"
```

The system picks up the package context:

```markdown
# Session Specification

**Session ID**: phase00-session03-api-models
**Phase**: 00 - Foundation
**Package**: apps/api
**Package Stack**: Python 3.12 + FastAPI
**Created**: 2026-01-10
```

Tasks are scoped to the package directory:

```markdown
- [ ] T001 [S0003] Create SQLAlchemy base model (`apps/api/src/models/base.py`)
- [ ] T002 [S0003] Define User model (`apps/api/src/models/user.py`)
- [ ] T003 [S0003] Define Organization model (`apps/api/src/models/org.py`)
- [ ] T004 [S0003] Create Alembic migration config (`apps/api/alembic.ini`)
```

#### Implementation with package validation

```
User: /implement
```

`check-prereqs.sh` validates the package:

```json
{
  "package": {
    "registered": {"status": "pass", "info": "apps/api"},
    "directory": {"status": "pass", "info": "apps/api"},
    "manifest": {"status": "pass", "info": "pyproject.toml"},
    "stack": {"status": "pass", "info": "Python"}
  },
  "workspace": {
    "manager": {"status": "pass", "info": "pnpm"},
    "runner": {"status": "pass", "info": "turbo"}
  }
}
```

During implementation, if a task tries to modify a file outside `apps/api/`, the system logs a warning (unless the session is cross-cutting).

#### Completion with package metadata

```
User: /updateprd
```

State.json records the package:

```json
"completed_sessions": [
  { "id": "phase00-session01-project-setup", "package": null },
  { "id": "phase00-session02-shared-types", "package": "packages/shared" },
  { "id": "phase00-session03-api-models", "package": "apps/api" }
]
```

### Phase Transition (Monorepo)

```
User: /audit
```

The audit installs tools per-package based on stack:
- Root: Prettier, ESLint (shared config)
- `apps/web`: TypeScript strict mode, Jest
- `apps/api`: Ruff (formatter + linter), pytest, mypy
- `packages/shared`: TypeScript, Jest

```
User: /pipeline
```

Generates CI/CD with path-filtered triggers:
- `apps/web/**` changes trigger web build + test
- `apps/api/**` changes trigger API build + test
- `packages/shared/**` changes trigger shared build + downstream rebuilds

```
User: /carryforward
```

Lessons are tagged with package context:
```markdown
- [P00-apps/api] FastAPI dependency injection works cleanly with SQLAlchemy sessions
- [P00-packages/shared] Export TypeScript types as a separate build step for consumption
- [P00] pnpm workspace hoisting reduces install time by 40% vs npm
```

### Key Monorepo Takeaways

1. **One .spec_system/ at the root** -- not per-package
2. **Sessions interleave** -- session 02 might be `packages/shared`, session 03 `apps/api`
3. **Phase completion is global** -- all 6 sessions must complete, not "3 web sessions done"
4. **Cross-cutting sessions are normal** -- use them for workspace config, CI/CD, shared infra
5. **Package context is automatic** -- flows from stub annotations through spec.md to implementation
